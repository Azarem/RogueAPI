# RogueAPI

This is a public API for creating mods and plugins for Rogue Legacy. To be used in conjunction with Rogue Launcher (check Releases).

To make a plugin, create a folder called \Plugins\(PluginName) in the Rogue Legacy game directory. Change PluginName to whatever you want to call your plugin. A .dll file will be compiled when the launcher starts.

No documentation is available at this time.
